## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082), chosen for its association with intuition, reflection, and introspection, aligning with the app's focus on deeper connections. This color evokes a sense of calm and inner peace, encouraging users to engage in thoughtful self-expression.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA), a very desaturated tone of the primary indigo that provides a soft, serene backdrop that is easy on the eyes. It enhances the overall sense of tranquility and encourages introspection without overwhelming the user.
- Accent color: Violet (#8F00FF), used to draw attention to key interactive elements and notifications, while remaining harmonious with the overall color scheme. This vibrant hue injects a subtle energy, signalling opportunities for users to explore connections or new insights.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' sans-serif, for an elegant, high-end, artistic feel. Body font: 'Alegreya' serif, for readability and a literary feel.
- Use simple, outlined icons for navigation and key features. These should be easily recognizable and consistent throughout the app, promoting ease of use and intuitive interaction.
- Employ a clean, card-based design for displaying user profiles and journal entries, which provides a structured and digestible presentation of content. Utilize white space effectively to avoid clutter and maintain focus.
- Use subtle, gentle transitions when loading new content or navigating between sections. Micro-interactions like slight scaling or fading can add a sense of delight and polish to the user experience without being distracting.
