# anuvaad

**anuvaad** is a mobile-first web application designed to help users form meaningful connections based on deep personality insights. The core mission is to "translate experiences into real, meaningful connections" by moving beyond superficial profiles and focusing on genuine compatibility derived from self-reflection.

The application leverages an AI-powered journaling companion, Anu, to guide users through introspection. The insights gathered from these journal entries are then used to generate a personality persona, which becomes the foundation for matching users into small, compatible groups called "Tribes."
